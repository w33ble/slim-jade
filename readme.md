Welcome to Slim-Jade
===

What?
---

This is a boilerplate. It's the [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/) with [jade.php](https://github.com/everzet/jade.php) to render views

Why?
---

I like the Sinatra style MVC and love [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/).

I prefer to use Node and Express, but needed to bang out something quick and I'm more proficient in PHP. So, Slim+Jade was born.

How?
---

1. git clone git@github.com:w33ble/slim-jade.git
2. cd slim-jade/vendor
3. git clone https://github.com/everzet/jade.php.git
4. git clone https://github.com/codeguy/Slim.git

Files of import:

- bootstrap.php : All the app configuration happens here
- index.php : All your routes live here
